For our creative portion, we first decided to make it so that you can see all users on the site at once and what room they're in at all times. This way, the user can know where to find their friends.

We also used JQuery to send messages through a stroke of the Enter key rather than a click of the Send button. This enhances the site's usability. It's easier to hit enter than to use the trackpad to click a button.

Additionally, we clear the message input field after a message is sent. This way users don't have to manually delete their prior message from the form.

Finally, we notify all members of a room when a user leaves the room and when a user joins the room.
