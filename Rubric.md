Overview:
For our creative project, we plan to make a website to house College Baseball statistics and information. Currently, information is scattered throughout the NCAA statistics repository. Our website would centralize the important information about any team. Additionally, we plan to create tools for visualizing pitch data that may be charted by hand.
